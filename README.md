## 📘 About This Project

In this repository, I use **React JS 18** and **React Router DOM** to create a basic yet powerful webpage layout.

- 🧱 The layout structure includes a reusable **Header**, **Footer**, and **Main Content Area**.
- 🧭 It implements **client-side routing** using React Router DOM v6+.
- 🔗 URLs are optimized for SEO and user-friendly navigation (e.g., `/about`, `/contact`).
- 📁 A well-organized folder structure makes it easy to scale.

This layout is perfect for beginners, portfolios, small business websites, or as a base for larger web applications.
